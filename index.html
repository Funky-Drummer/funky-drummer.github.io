<p> This is a list of all the songs ive made!! I will try to update this as much as I can but will likely forget because im stupid. 
I love making songs in random and/or unintuitive DAWs, as well as things that aren’t even supposed to be used as a DAW! </p>

Update:


<h1> FL Studio </h1>
<p> My favorite DAW. My wallet’s least favorite. These will likely be the highest quality over anything else, but it won’t be the only DAW I use. </p>


<h3>Lento</h3>
<p>Named lento because the tempo is in lento. Because thats what producers do when they cant think of a name. Look at largo, allegro, many songs are just named after the tempo they're in.
Also its my first song in FL! Really happy with it, though FL is like really hard to learn without a tutorial, but i did it and almost cried after finding out how simple it is.</p>


<h1> Garageband </h1>
<p> These are songs I made in Garageband, obviously. </p>


<h2> Actual Songs <h2>
<p> Songs I made with instruments and notes. Started here, still here. </p>


<h3> Among The Stars </h3>
<p> My first actual song! Actually really proud of how this turned out! </p>

<h3> Jizzles </h3>
<p> A song I made with a few other variants due to a comment someone made </p>

<h3> Jazzles </h3> 
<p> Obviously, a variant of jizzles. Okay, I should probably explain the comment. So, I shared Jizzles with one of my friends. They are not very musically educated (they said this themselves) and said “what genre is it, Jazz?” and I was like how the heck is that jazz, and he said he didn't know and it was funny. So, just for shits and Jizzles, I decided to remake half the drums, slow the tempo, and change up the instruments to show him what “jazz” would be. Then I proceeded to make two more, which I can get to right now and already have as soon as I could! </p>

<h3> Brazzles </h3>
<p> Jizzles, but brass instruments. Why? uhh… </p>

<h3> Pebbles </h3>
<p> Jizzles, but rock. Thought Pebbles would be a good name for a variant of Jizzles and pebbles are rocks so boom rock and roll. </p>



<h2> Miscellaneous Named Cadences </h2>
<p> I mean they're named at least </p>

<h3> Chess Beat Arrangement </h3>
<p> This is a reference to Icely Puzzles. Chess Battle Advanced. What's so advanced about it? The beat sequencer spells cba. Thats basically it lol. </p>


<h3> Coffee Shop Cadence </h3>
<p> This one is named after the drum kit it’s played on, called Coffee Shop. Also everyone loves this one but I can’t think of ideas for a second one so sorry :( </p>

<h3> Funky Drummer </h3>
<p> This is just my spin on the collage band cadence Funky Drummer. Name sounds familiar for some reason… </p>

<h3> Funky Drummer, But The Right Ear Is Funky Drummer And The Left Ear Is A 20 Car Pile-Up And Mass Homicide </h3>
<p> Don’t ask. I genuinely don’t know. </p>

<h3> Pots and Pans 1 </h3> 
<h3> Pots and Pans 2 </h3>
<p> These are also named after the kit they’re played on, called Pots and Pans. </p>

<h3> Miscellaneous Unnamed Cadences </h3>
<ol>
<li>1 
<li>2 
<li>3 
<li>4 
<li>5 
<li>6 
</ol>


<h1> BeepBox </h1>
<p> These I can just use links for!! But the thingy things are really long (thats what she said) so ill be masking them for the convenience of both of us. Also the second link is on catbox if you just want the files. <br>
These are songs I made in BeepBox, obviously. Technically UltraBox but it’s literally a modded version so bleh. </p>

<h3> Fleeting Memory </h3>
<p> My first song on BeepBox! Went for a lo-fi vibe, pretty happy with it! The vibrato really did a lot! Also loopable if you cut off the last two measures and the first one! </p>

<h3> Blou </h3>
<p> This isn’t necessarily a “blues” song but it is definitely inspired by those blues songs with the sick as hell solos I grew up with. </p>

<h3> The Bug In My Ear </h3>
<p> Decided I wanted to ruin a perfectly good song I was working on while also keeping it symbolic. First, the bug isn’t really bothering you. Then it starts to get annoying. Then you kill it and its entire family and listen as they scream in agony!! :D </p>

<h3> Hemeko! </h3>
<p> A nice little experiment with vibrato on a piano and swing drums in an otherwise non swing song. </p>

<h3> Nightlife </h3>
<p> A nice, funky, yet kinda sluggish swing song. Made in school spontaneously, still sounds really good somehow. </p>





<h1> Thirty Dollar Website </h1>
<p> These you’ll have to put in yourself, like import the file to the website because they wanted to make it difficult but I made things here so woohoo…
Using catbox again. </p> 

<h3> Pow! </h3>
<p> I mean I just kinda did stuff and it sounds nice so this is what I made. Also the only one of these I made because this is really unintuitive as a DAW, but as you all may or may not know that’s my thing which I know contradicts my previous statement but shut up. </p>






<h1> Chiptunes </h1>
<p> These ones are made in various programs, with the same general premise. If you don’t know what chiptunes are, basically, it is a term for songs played on sound chips from old gaming devices. Old as in old old. Back when the Famicom, or the NES was around, the GameBoy, Atari, stuff like that, those are chiptunes. And yes, the music from the games are also chiptunes, obviously. </p>

<h3> Unnamed Chiptune 1 </h3>
<p> This was made using FamiStudio. Yes, I know BeepBox is a perfectly fine way to make chiptunes, and I'm honestly better there than here, but I got FamiStudio so I could practice programming an NES sound chip or some similar type of sound chip. Plus, I just think chiptunes are just really creative. </p>

<h3> Unnamed Chiptune 2 (new) </h3>
<p> Made in FamiStudio. This is a filler song I made in 3 days because I haven’t uploaded in a while and I felt the need to provide evidence that I haven’t like died or something. I also just felt bad for being kinda lazy and taking so long so here you go! Hope you like it! I haven’t put any less effort into it than my other songs, but I was kinda stressed at the time, and felt time pressure for some reason. No, this wasn’t made in the hex editor, but I did look at the hex code the entire time to see how a change would change it. Because when the changes change, you needa change what you know about changes. What? I’ll shut up now. </p><br>
<br>
<p> Maybe in the future, I’ll write a song using only the hex editor… </p>
